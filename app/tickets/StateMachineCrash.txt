sporadic behaviour:
	FilePlayback + custom ReflexConditioningSignalProcessing + DummyApplication
	
	variant (a)
	
			2014-02-14T16:10:15 - Error in Unhandled exception of type std::bad_alloc:
			bad allocation
			Canceling thread of type StateMachine.

		...but the run continued - i.e. FilePlayback and ReflexConditioningSignalProcessing
		continued delivering results correctly.

	variant (b)
	
		The same behaviour sometimes occurs with an error other than "bad allocation" -
		e.g. "Win32 access violation" followed by a hex code, followed by the same end result,
		i.e. "Canceling thread of type StateMachine".

	
	variant (c)
		
		The same circumstances (sporadic, unpredictable) and final error message ("Canceling
		thread of type StateMachine"), but preceded by:
		
			Error reading message of type 0x401 (VisSignal), nominal length: 2048, read: 25
			Function: bci::MessageChannel::HandleMessage()
			File: ..\..\..\..\src\shared\modules\MessageChannel.cpp
			Line: 165
			Canceling thread of type StateMachine
	
		Note that this apparently visualization-related message can arise even if all Visualization
		parameters are 0 and hence no visualizations are open or required.
