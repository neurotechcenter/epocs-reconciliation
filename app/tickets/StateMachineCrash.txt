sporadic behaviour:
	FilePlayback + custom ReflexConditioningSignalProcessing + DummyApplication

		2014-02-14T16:10:15 - Error in Unhandled exception of type std::bad_alloc:
		bad allocation
		Canceling thread of type StateMachine.

	but the run continued - i.e. FilePlayback and ReflexConditioningSignalProcessing continued delivering results correctly.

	The same behaviour sometimes occurs with an error other than "bad allocation" - e.g. "Win32 access violation" followed by
	a hex code, followed by the same end result, i.e. "Canceling thread of type StateMachine".
