On 64-bit Windows 8 using 32-bit Release builds of command-line tools from BCI2000 source r4700:

> cd c:\BCI2000
> tools\cmdline\bci_dat2stream.exe -ptools\matlab\ExampleParameters.prm --duration=0:10 < data\samplefiles\eeg3_2.dat >   dat2stream-eeg3_2-bin32win64.bin
> tools\cmdline\TransmissionFilter.exe < dat2stream-eeg3_2-bin32win64.bin > out

Logic Error: Error reading message of type 0x321 (unknown), nominal length: 31045, read: 0
Function: bci::MessageChannel::HandleMessage()
File: ..\..\..\..\src\shared\modules\MessageChannel.cpp
Line: 165
Aborting TransmissionFilter.

NB: It is possible to show that it is the *output* mechanism of bci_dat2stream, TransmissionFilter and
friends, and probably not their input, that is corrupted, Using a version of the tools that is known to work
(i.e. my 64-bit native OSX binaries from whichever svn release of BCI2000 last compiled on the Mac - possibly circa early 2013?
I created dat2stream-eeg3_2-bin64osx64.bin and transferred this over to the Windows machine.  The Windows TransmissionFilter.exe
successfully processed this, but the problem was only pushed one step down the chain: subsequent filters in the chain
(e.g. SpatialFilter.exe) produce exactly the same error (Logic Error, MessageChannel.cpp line 165 while reading "unknown"
type message) when they attempt to process the output of TransmissionFilter.exe

The error still occurs when bci_dat2stream.exe is run without command-line options (but --duration=0:10 helps to make the
binary files more manageable in size)
