This a bug that I can work around but not fix, involving IIRBandpass /
IIRFilterBase.   Whenever I enabled
the high-pass filter I would get either a stoppage (operator clock
keeps ticking in the title-bar, but the source window and all other
visualizers stop) or a crash (unhandled windows exception, access
violation, terminating thread of type IIRFilter).   This would appear
to happen non-deterministically---it happens at different points in
the run even if I play back the same file each time as source. Also, I
never noticed it during development on my laptop (8-core 2.5GHz i7
running 64-bit Windows 8), but it happens nearly always within the
first 2 minutes of a run on the lab machine (4-core 3.3GHz i3 running
32-bit Windows 7). In both cases the binary is the same (32-bit
Release build).

I varied the parameters a bit but it always seemed to be dangerous,
The particular parameters I'm running with are SourceCh=4,
SampleBlockSize=64, SamplingRate=1600, HighPassCorner=0.5Hz and
HighPassOrder=2 (notch and lowpass disabled)

After some very crude debugging I think the problem can be prevented
by launching with --NumberOfThreads=1, so that's the workaround I've
been using.
