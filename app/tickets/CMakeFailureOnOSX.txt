The following 3 problems were observed with the cmake system on OSX, using
up-to-date sources from the svn HEAD on 2013-12-05 (following one exchange
of emails with Juergen that fixed other osx-cmake problems):


(1) PyffApplication's CMakeLists.txt requires PythonLibs version 2.7
or later.  If this version is not present on the system, the result is
a fatal error which prevents CMake from completing, for all the other
targets. Obviously the failure of one target shouldn't affect the
others but I was unable to figure out how to prevent this except by
brutally commenting out ADD_SUBDIRECTORY( PyffApplication )

It's probably not a good solution to simply demand the user install
Python 2.7. Unfortunately installing and upgrading Python (and in
particular, any third-party Python packages you might rely on for your
project) is an absolute nightmare on the mac (it's much easier on windows
and linux).  It took a couple of days' solid work to get my 2.6 tree
installed on my mac, which I'm not keen to repeat until I absolutely have
to.



(2) The code itself doesn't compile.  There are hundreds of lines of errors -
this is the first error I got running `make Operator` with up-to-date sources on
2013-12-05:

[  4%] Building CXX object

error: 'sem_t' does not name a type




(3) There is also a Qt error (log below) demanding version >= 4.7.0.
I have long forgotten which version of the Qt I have, or even how to
*query* which version I have.     I seem to be able to work around
this by going into CMakeCache and setting USE_EXTERNAL_QT=ON  (which I
discovered by chance on
http://www.bci2000.org/wiki/index.php/Programming_Reference:Building_Qt_for_BCI2000
and tried at random). But I presume we're not demanding that most
users do that.  What would be the standard procedure for normal users?
 Can we give more precise instructions than "install Qt >=4.7.0 on
your machine"?  I dimly remember that one has to install not
just the "Qt Libraries" that are easy to find on qt-project.org but
also the "QT SomethingElse" where SomethingElse possibly == "SDK" or
possibly "Framework' (qt-project.org isn't helpful on this issue)

There is no precompiled version of Qt available for your platform/compiler.
You will need to install Qt >=4.7.0 on your machine in order to build BCI2000.
