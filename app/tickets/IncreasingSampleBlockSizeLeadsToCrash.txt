Let the "critical size" be defined as the SampleBlockSize that was set
when you did setconfig for the very first time since launch.    On
subsequent setconfigs, the user can change SampleBlockSize down and up
and down and up again provided you do not exceed the critical size.
However, if you go above the critical size, you get an access
violation leading to termination of one or more modules (it seems
random which core modules are affected - all are at risk).  You may
(on rare occasions) also get an additional error message that has
something to do with not being able to decode a message in the
visualization system (sorry, didn't write this down).

This was observed using 32-bit Release-mode binaries on a 64-bit
windows 7 system using either SignalGenerator or gUSBampSource as the
source module,  and usually using DummySignalProcessing and
DummyApplication.
