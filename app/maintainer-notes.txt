Notes from initial EPOCS setup attempts, May 2020

The Visual Studio 2012 Redistributable package (32-bit version) had to be downloaded and installed in order to get past "VCOMP110.DLL not found" errors.
The 64-bit version does not appear to be required. (I installed that first, having been misled into thinking everything was 64-bit now.
Note that some BCI2000 binaries appear to be 64-bit, like Operator.exe and DummyApplication.exe, whereas others like aReflexConditioningSignalProcessing.exe
and NIDAQ_mx_Source.exe are 32-bit; nonetheless they seem to work together with each other---who knew? The Python 2.7 distro definitely has to be 32-bit,
otherwise it will fail to load the BCI2000 remote DLL (currently using FullMonty275 as of old.)

Presumably aReflexConditioningSignalProcessing.exe (and maybe others?) were built non-statically-linked, hence the VCOMP110.DLL problem.
Note the different name. Perhaps the 'a' stands for Amir?   What are the differences relative to the original, and where are the sources?

NIDigitalOutputPort.prm  appears to be intended to be generated automatically by the NISetup/NIDigitalOutput.exe utility.
As such, it needed to be removed from version control (it's now getting ignored) and re-generated. This corrected an error whereby the system was looking
for the wrong board. This parameter file is the subject of a lot of semantic confusion.  For one thing, despite its name it's not just about output: it
specifies input channel addresses/names/gains as well, and the utility performs calibration of these. For another thing, there's some logic in epocs.py
that sets a variable called DigitimerSetup according to the presence or absence of this file, yet clearly it's NI-specific and its relationship to Digitimer
is tangential/coincidental at best. Note that there's also a NIAnalogOutput.exe utility in the NISetup directory, and that *also* (despite *its* name)
overwrites NIDigitalOutputPort.prm---the differences being that it sets the AnalogOutput parameter to 1 and adds an extra row to FilterExpressions.
Neither of these two parameters appears in the original C++ sources---they must be defined in the missing sources of aReflexConditioningSignalProcessing
(note: FilterExpressions is an inappropriately generic name and should be changed).

Where are the sources for these NI*Output.exe utilities? Looks like they're Qt applications...

Note that it's easy to get NIDigitalOutput.exe wrong: we use P0.7 in our default hardware setup, but the application's default is P0.0: remember to change it!

I fixed various `AttributeError: stimGUI` instances (but the straight-up brokenness of that raises the question of whether this is the version of EPOCS we
should be starting with at all. It seems the Windows-10-Tim-bitbucketed version had never been tested in the absence of a Digitimer stimulator).

One of the command-line tools (tools/cmdline/bci_stream2mat.exe) goes missing periodically on Aiko's lab computer #1---possibly the victim of a realtime
virus scanner?
